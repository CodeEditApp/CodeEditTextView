    // MARK: - Layout Lines

    /// Lays out all visible lines
    ///
    /// ## Overview Of The Layout Routine
    ///
    /// The basic premise of this method is that it loops over all lines in the given rect (defaults to the visible
    /// rect), checks if the line needs a layout calculation, and performs layout on the line if it does.
    ///
    /// The thing that makes this layout method so fast is the second point, checking if a line needs layout. To
    /// determine if a line needs a layout pass, the layout manager can check three things:
    /// - **1** Was the line laid out under the assumption of a different maximum layout width?
    ///   For instance, if a line was previously broken by the line wrapping setting, it won’t need to wrap once the
    ///   line wrapping is disabled. This will detect that, and cause the lines to be recalculated.
    /// - **2** Was the line previously not visible? This is determined by keeping a set of visible line IDs. If the
    ///   line does not appear in that set, we can assume it was previously off screen and may need layout.
    /// - **3** Was the line entirely laid out? We break up lines into line fragments. When we do layout, we determine
    ///   all line fragments but don't necessarily place them all in the view. This checks if all line fragments have
    ///   been placed in the view. If not, we need to place them.
    ///
    /// Once it has been determined that a line needs layout, we perform layout by recalculating it's line fragments,
    /// removing all old line fragment views, and creating new ones for the line.
    ///
    /// ## Laziness
    ///
    /// At the end of the layout pass, we clean up any old lines by updating the set of visible line IDs and fragment
    /// IDs. Any IDs that no longer appear in those sets are removed to save resources. This facilitates the text view's
    /// ability to only render text that is visible and saves tons of resources (similar to the lazy loading of
    /// collection or table views).
    ///
    /// The other important lazy attribute is the line iteration. Line iteration is done lazily. As we iterate
    /// through lines and potentially update their heights, the next line is only queried for *after* the updates are
    /// finished.
    ///
    /// ## Reentry
    ///
    /// An important thing to note is that this method cannot be reentered. If a layout pass has begun while a layout
    /// pass is already ongoing, internal data structures will be broken. In debug builds, this is checked with a simple
    /// boolean and assertion.
    ///
    /// To help ensure this property, all view modifications are performed within a `CATransaction`. This guarantees
    /// that macOS calls `layout` on any related views only after we’ve finished inserting and removing line fragment
    /// views. Otherwise, inserting a line fragment view could trigger a layout pass prematurely and cause this method
    /// to re-enter.
    /// - Warning: This is probably not what you're looking for. If you need to invalidate layout, or update lines, this
    ///            is not the way to do so. This should only be called when macOS performs layout.
